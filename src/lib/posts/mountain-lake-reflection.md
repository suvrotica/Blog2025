# Mountain Lake Photography

Early morning at the mountain lake presents a photographer's dream. The still waters create perfect reflections of the surrounding peaks, while the first light of dawn paints the sky in dramatic hues.

## Photography Tips

1. Arrive before sunrise for the best light
2. Use a tripod for sharp reflections
3. Consider using graduated ND filters
4. Try both wide and telephoto compositions
